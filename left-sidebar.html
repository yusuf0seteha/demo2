						    <blockquote>
						      <p> <strong>1. understand the goal of your campaign</strong>&nbsp;</p>
					      </blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first step is to collaborate with your team on the particulars of the campaign. Are you promoting an event? Are you offering a new ebook or download? Maybe you're working on a social giving campaign with a non-profit partner. Whatever the campaign is, understand the end goal. What action do you want the user or follower to take when they see your post? Is the goal clearly articulated, while still being entertaining, lovable and share-worthy? How will you measure the effectiveness of the campaign?</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <blockquote>
                              <p> <strong>2 .Appeal to you target audience It should always be your highest priority to make sure your content and messaging appeal to your target audience.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
                            </blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is an essential rule to keep in mind throughout your social media marketing campaign. Keep in mind who you're trying to reach out to and why. Otherwise, your audience will simply scroll past your social posts or lose interest in your campaign.&nbsp;</p>
                          <p>Here are some ways to appeal to your target audience on social media:&nbsp;​</p>
                          <p>Consider the current trends going around these days. What do people want to watch during your present time? Instagram stories and live streaming, for example, have become very popular. Are you able to merge these patterns into your social media campaign and routine?&nbsp;</p>
                          <p>​ Provide useful information. Make the viewers want to take a break and listen to you. Why would they check out your post or campaign if you don't have information worth their time? Build a giveaway that allows your audience to read your explanation from beginning to end as an incentive to read it. Also, let them know how they can enter the giveaway and when the winner will be announced. ​&nbsp;</p>
                          <p>Create visually appealing content that is both creative and convincing. Make sure your visual content is convincing and entertaining, whether it's a video on Facebook or an edited photo on Instagram. Give the viewers something exclusive to look at.&nbsp;​</p>
                          <p>Always try to engage with your audience. people expect businesses to reply within 24 hours of posting on social media, according to 84 percent of them. You should respond to your followers' questions, comments, and complaints if they leave them on your blogs. You'll establish a personal connection with your audience, which will increase their loyalty to you and your brand. You'll also have a better chance of gaining their confidence.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                          <blockquote>
                              <p> <strong> 3. manage the results of your campaign strategy&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;</p>
                          </blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regardless of why you're starting your campaign, you'll most likely want to know how successful it is. in order to draw some conclusions about the success of your campaign you'll need some kind of metrics to track and control during your campaign.&nbsp;</p>
                          <p>A metric tracker, such as Google Analytics or HubSpot's social monitoring and metric tracking app, is a common way to do this. This type of statistical evidence will tell you things like how much total campaign traffic there is, how many new followers you get (and how many you lose), the level of interaction, improvements in website traffic, and any changes in sales. Social media platforms, such as Instagram and Twitter, have recently begun to provide access to convert personal accounts into business accounts for a higher levels of monitoring your customers who interact with your business.</p>
